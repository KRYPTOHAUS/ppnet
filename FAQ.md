#### What is PPnet?

It is a minimalistic social network that is very easy to install and to use. You and your buddies can post text and images, which can be commented and liked.

#### Why would I need it?
Because you want to use a social network without selling your soul to the big proprietary social networks.

#### Who owns my data?
You.

That's the whole point and that's why you need to setup a database. We do keep an example database up and running but this is only for demonstration purposes.

#### What do I need to create my own PPnet instance?
You only need some free web space to put the web pages on and a provider for your couchdb - [Cloudant](https://cloudant.com/), for example, has a free plan. Just follow the [simple setup instructions](https://github.com/pixelpark/ppnet#steps-for-a-simple-quickstart).

Btw - there are free developer ressources listed [here](https://github.com/ripienaar/free-for-dev).

#### But I want to run it on my own server!
We've got you covered - here is [how you install it](https://github.com/pixelpark/ppnet/blob/master/BUILD.md). Here is a script that sets [everything up on Amazon EC2 in one take](https://gist.github.com/dirkk0/f7169b42055a013758c3).

#### Can I access PPnet via web browser?
Yes, on both desktop as mobile - as long as it is a somewhat recent version.

#### Can I have native Apps, too?
[Yes](https://github.com/pixelpark/ppnet/blob/master/BUILD.md#build-the-phonegapcordova-app).

#### What if my mobile device loses network connectivity?
You can still read old status updates. You can even post. Both posts and status updates will be synchronized once your phone re-connects.

#### Is it OpenSource?
[Yes](https://github.com/pixelpark/ppnet/blob/master/LICENSE.md).

#### Is it free?
Yes.

#### Do you support it?
Sure. If you need help, just [create an issue](https://github.com/pixelpark/ppnet/issues) or shoot us an email. Additionally, we are able to provide professional services.

In any case - if you have PPnet up and running we'd like to hear from you!
